    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "Now we'll pick three supervised learning models that are appropriate for this problem, using them to predict the income slab's.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. *Gradient Boosting:*\n",
    "*   **Application**:\n",
    "    - Anamoly detection in DNA Sequences, credit card transactions and CyberSecurity.\n",
    "*   **Strength**:\n",
    "    - Often provides predictive accuracy that cannot be beaten. \n",
    "    - Lots of flexibility - can optimize on different loss functions and provides several hyperparameter tuning options that make the function fit very flexible.\n",
    "    - Can handle different types of predictor variables and accomodate missing data.\n",
    "*   **Weakness**:\n",
    "    - GBMs will continue improving to minimize all errors. This can overemphasize outliers and cause overfitting.\n",
    "    - Computationally expensive - GBMs often require many trees (>1000) which can be time and memory exhaustive.\n",
    "*   **Candidacy**:\n",
    "    - As the given data is highly skewed, we need an algorithm that generalizes well and does not memorize the training set.Also, we want good accuracy with our predictions which our model satisfies.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## 2. *Support Vector Machines:*\n",
    "*   **Application**:\n",
    "    - Protein Structure Prediction\n",
    "*   **Strength**:\n",
    "    - With an appropriate kernel function, we can solve any complex problem.\n",
    "    - It scales relatively well to high dimensional data.\n",
    "    - SVM models have generalization in practice, the risk of over-fitting is less in SVM.\n",
    "*   **Weakness**:\n",
    "    - Long training time for large datasets.\n",
    "    - The SVM hyper parameters are Cost -C and gamma. It is not that easy to fine-tune these hyper-parameters. It is hard to visualize their impact\n",
    "*   **Candidacy**:\n",
    "    - SVMs were chosen because of their effectiveness given high dimensionality. Due to our one-hot encoding feature transformation, i.e. after incorporating dummy variables, we got more than 100 features in our dataset, so SVMs should be a classifier that works regardless of that. Also, our dataset is not that large(<100k records) to be a deterrent.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## 3. *Decision Tree Classifier:*\n",
    "*   **Application**:\n",
    "    - Cosmic-Ray Classification in Hubble Space Telescope Images.\n",
    "*   **Strength**:\n",
    "    - Decision trees provide a clear indication of which fields are most important for prediction or classification.\n",
    "    - Decision trees perform classification without requiring much computation.\n",
    "    - A Decision trees model is very intuitive and easy to explain to technical teams as well as stakeholders.\n",
    "*   **Weakness**:\n",
    "    - A small change in the data can cause a large change in the structure of the decision tree causing instability.\n",
    "    - Decision Tree algorithm is inadequate for applying regression and predicting continuous values.\n",
    "*   **Candidacy**:\n",
    "    - As Decision Trees basically answer True/False questions, they can help us to rule out features/dimensions which don't play a pivotal role in determining the income and help us focus on those features which have a higher impact for classification of candidates."

    "To understand gradient boosting we must first understand two important aspects of it: 1.Descison Trees 2.Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Descion Trees:** \n",
    "      - This is basically defined as a decision support tool that uses tree like structure/model of decisions and their possible consequences. Here each node of the tree is a \"test\"(question),each branch is outcome of this test and each leaf represents a class label which we are trying to predict.\n",
    "      - So,by answering certain set questions one by one realting to the system we end up with potentially correct or incorrect answers,The strategy here is that the first set of questions have to be broad in order to eliminate multiple outcomes and the last few questions have to be very specific to get the correct outcomes.\n",
    "      - Finally,we end you with a big tree which has all the possible outcomes of all decisons and can be used to predict furture outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Boosting:** \n",
    "      - This is best explained by an example of a factory worker,who is working in an assembly line and is trained to perform a specific task ,he/she performs well on in their local and very specific tasks but overall they can't do much and are quite weak for other tasks,but if we combine multiple workers each having different expertise/skills and make them work on their individual tasks,we end up making the final product efficiently.\n",
    "      - This is the basic idea behind boosting,here we bundle up multiple classifers and make a final model which works accurately in predicitng accross all areas of the dataset in question.\n",
    "        \n",
    "*Now,what Gradient Boosting actaully does is quite smart,it makes small and weak decision trees and checks how many outcomes it has misclassified,then it builds another tree which helps to correct the errors made by previous tree by changing some parameters.*\n",
    "       *This process keeps going on sequentially until we have reached a certain threshold of acceptable error rate and we end up with a single tree which is basically a combination of small weak decision trees.This final tree is more expressive and can address multiple areas efficiently.*"

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "- Reducing the data to only five features also reduces the F-score and accuracy of the predictions. I believe this is due to the classifier not being able to accurately capture the complexity of the data and therefore lose out on some information . However, if the training time was an important factor, reducing the number of features should reduce training time. Furthermore, since the impact on the accuracy and/or the F-scores is not too large, the small increase in classification error could be an appropriate tradeoff in that scenario"
